This git project is cool because it's a shaders pack for unity.
It would be really cool to see what this affects in unity and how this was even made.
The creator shows some of the effects on the page and it looks very high quality.

This is an MMO game made in unity and I think this is cool because I am going to be creating a game in unity for the midterm project.
It's cool to see the products of things people have made in unity with some time invested.
The game looks like it has decent graphics and has a good concept behind it.

This git project is cool because it is a plugin that infinately scrolls down.
It's interesting to me how to make a program to interact with your computer or another program.

https://github.com/tusenpo/FlappyFrog.git
This git project is interesting because it is an off brand flappy bird type game.
The game has a link that it can be played on google and it's interesting to me how stuff like that is done.

https://github.com/Codeusa/SteamCleaner.git
This project is cool because it is a program written in c++ that cleans out your pc game libraries.
It cleans out your steam, origin, or Uplay library to clear up pc disk space.
I really like the idea of a program managing my storage for me instead of me having to manually decide what i dont use anymore.
